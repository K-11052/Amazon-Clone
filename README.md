# Amazon-Clone
This project is a fully responsive Amazon homepage clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the layout, structure, and design of Amazon’s main interface, including the navigation bar, hero section, product grid, and footer. The goal of this project was to practice modern UI design, improve CSS layout skills, and understand real-world website structuring.
